# template-copilot

Template project containing the basic copilot files for AI assisted project generation.

Suggested workflow for creating a new project:

1. Add project requirements, integrations, deployment patterns, environments, implementation details to the copilot-instrctions.md
2. Add prompt.md files for specific commands you would like to have available in your project (e.g. build, deploy, install, create, etc.)
3. Add instructions.md files to provide context to specific files, file types, or directories in your project.
